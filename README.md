# Design Patterns

The `Core` project contains implementations of some basic design patterns, primarily for my own reference. Note that some of the implementations may be incomplete or in need of serious refactoring.  

## Building and Running the Solution

Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2012 and hit `F7` to build. Hit `F5` to run a console application that runs through examples of each of the patterns.

## Credits

There are many great examples on the web of how to implement these patterns. For example,
